# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this task, I developed a predictive model to determine passenger survival on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset from Codsoft. By applying machine learning techniques and data preprocessing, I analyzed features such as age, gender, and passenger class to build and evaluate models for accurate survival predictions. The goal was to leverage data-driven insights to improve model performance and provide actionable results for further analysis
