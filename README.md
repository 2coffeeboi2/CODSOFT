# CODSOFT
Welcome to my repository of data science internship projects from Codsoft. Here you'll find various projects I've worked on, including code, datasets, and detailed documentation. Explore my work, contribute if you'd like, and find inspiration for your own data science journey!

# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this task, I developed a predictive model to determine passenger survival on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset from Codsoft. By applying machine learning techniques and data preprocessing, I analyzed features such as age, gender, and passenger class to build and evaluate models for accurate survival predictions. The goal was to leverage data-driven insights to improve model performance and provide actionable results for further analysis

# Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction
This task aims to predict movie ratings using a machine learning model. The dataset from CODSOFT includes user ratings and movie metadata. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate ratings for unseen movies based on user preferences and movie features. Key components include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training with evaluation metrics to assess performance

# Task 3: Iris FLower Classification
This task aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements using the Iris dataset. The project involves preprocessing the data, training classification algorithms, and evaluating model performance for accurate species prediction
